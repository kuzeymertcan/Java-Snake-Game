# Java Snake Game
 A simple snake game developed using the Java programming language. Control the movement of the snake, increase your score by eating apples, and keep the game going without colliding with the snake itself or the boundaries. Implemented with the Swing library for creating a graphical user interface. A fun project for enhancing Java coding skills.
